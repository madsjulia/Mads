![](logos/mads_black_swan_logo_big_text_new_3inch.png)

[MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) is an integrated high-performance computational framework for data/model/decision analyses.

[MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) can be applied to perform:

* Sensitivity Analysis
* Parameter Estimation
* Model Inversion and Calibration
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Model Selection and Averaging
* Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling
* Machine Learning (e.g., Blind Source Separation, Source Identification, Feature Extraction, Matrix / Tensor Factorization, etc.)
* Decision Analysis and Support
