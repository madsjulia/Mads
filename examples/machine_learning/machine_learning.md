## Machine Learning

Unsupervised Machine Learning methods are powerful data-analytics tools capable of extracting important features hidden (latent) in large datasets without any prior information.
The physical interpretation of the extracted features is done *a posteriori* by subject-matter experts.

In contrast, supervised ML methods are trained based on large labeled datasets; the labeling is performed a priori by subject-matter experts.
The process of deep ML commonly includes both unsupervised and supervised techniques [LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539) where unsupervised ML are applied to facilitate the process of data labeling.

The integration of large datasets, powerful computational capabilities, and affordable data storage has resulted in the widespread use of Machine Learning in science, technology, and industry.

Recently we have developed a novel unsupervised Machine Learning methods.
The methods are based on Matrix/Tensor Factorization coupled with sparsity and nonnegativity constraints.
The method reveals the temporal and spatial footprints of the extracted features.
